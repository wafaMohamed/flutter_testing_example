1. Three Types of Tests in Flutter:

* Unit Test:
Used for testing individual functions or classes in isolation.
Utilizes the flutter_test library in dev_dependencies.
Run unit tests with the command: flutter test.
******************************
* Widget Test (Component Test):
Tests individual widgets by mocking their dependencies.
Uses the testWidgets function to build and interact with widgets.
Verifies widget behavior with the tester object, utilizing pumpWidget and assertions.
******************************
* Integration Test (End-to-End Testing):
Tests the entire app or significant parts of it.
Utilizes the flutter_driver and integration_test packages.
Requires actual devices for execution.
********************************************************************************************************
2. Unit Testing:
Install the (flutter_test) library by adding it to dev_dependencies.
* Run unit tests with the command: flutter test.
Ensure your terminal is in the project's root directory (cd path\to\your\flutter\project).
********************************************************************************************************
3. Widget Testing:
* Use the (testWidgets function for widget testing).
Interact with widgets using tester.tap and tester.pump.
Verify widget behavior with assertions using expect.
Locating and verifying widgets is done with the find and expect functions.
********************************************************************************************************
4. Integration Testing:
Create an integration_test folder in the project.
Add an integration test file (e.g., app_test.dart) inside the integration_test folder.
Add required packages: flutter_driver and integration_test.
************************************************************
5. Integration Test (End-to-End):
End-to-end testing verifies multiple components of the app together.
Requires testing on actual devices.
********************************************************************************************************
6. TDD versus. BDD:

* TDD (Test Driven Development):
Focuses on testing the implementation details.
Tests are written before the code is implemented.
*************************************************
* BDD (Behavior Driven Development):
Emphasizes testing the behavior of the app.
* Uses constructs like Given, When, Then to define test scenarios.
Tests are more aligned with user behavior.
*************************************************
7. How to Think Before Writing Unit Testing:

Consider the behavior of the code or function you are testing.
Identify different scenarios and edge cases.
Define expected outcomes for each scenario.
Write test cases that cover these scenarios and expectations.
