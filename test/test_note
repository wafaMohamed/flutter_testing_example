what is testing?
Ensuring your app does exactly what it should.
your test specific input AND expect specific output.
********************************************************************************************************
1- in flutter there are three types of test:
   1- unit test: we can test individual function or individual classes
   2- widget testing(component test): test individual widget by mocking its dependencies
   3- integration test (End-to-End) testing: test whole app it is being used by a user to confirm that everything is working or test large part of app.
********************************************************************************************************
2- unit testing: by (test) function you can test individual classes and function
   - flutter add build-in library called  flutter_test: in  dev_dependencies:
           flutter_test:
   - run the test by:
     flutter test
   - but first check the root:
   cd path\to\your\flutter\project
********************************************************************************************************
3- Widget Test:
   - by (testWidget) Function:
   - tester.(pumpWidget) is used to build and render the widget tree.
   - expect is used for making assertions in tests. In this case, it expects to find exactly one widget with the text 'Hello' in the widget tree.
   - Interacting with the Widget:
     * tester.tap simulates a tap on the widget found by find.byType(ElevatedButton).
     * tester.pump() triggers a frame to process the changes caused by the tap, after tap we need to wait for execution of one frame

   - Verification After Interaction:
     After tapping, it expects not to find any widget with the text 'Hello' (indicating it's removed),
     and it expects to find one widget with the text 'testing'.
     *summary:
     The (find) and (expect) functions are essential for locating and verifying widgets in the widget tree during testing.
********************************************************************************************************
4- Integration test: should to be in actual device.
   - add new folder called it => integration_test , don't put it in  test file
   and inside it any file called name(_test.dart)
    first file -> app_test.dart ->import flutter test and integration_test inside it

   - first add 2 packages:
      * flutter_driver:
      * test: //instead of flutter_test
      OR like a doc:
      * integration_test:
      * test:
********************************************************************************************************
5- Integration test(End-to-End): is a process of testing multiple components of an app together, to ensure that they function correctly as a whole.

********************************************************************************************************
6- what is the difference between TDD(Test Driven Development) - BDD(Behavior Driven Development)?
   * BDD(Behavior Driven Development):
     test more the behavior of app:
     Given
     When
     Then
     * so it test the behavior not implementation like TDD, like: test static initialization index with 0 that increase one
       => make it dynamic to  be automatically increase with any number.
